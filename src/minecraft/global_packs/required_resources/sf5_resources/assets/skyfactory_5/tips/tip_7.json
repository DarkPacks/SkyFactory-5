    "text": "Hello Mr. Darkosto, As a long-time fan of the Sky Factory franchise, I wanted to share my thoughts on Sky Factory 4. While I loved Sky Factory 3 and 2 for their realism and immersion, I found Sky Factory 4 disappointing. Many Reddit comments echo this sentiment, expressing a preference for Sky Factory 3. I hope future projects consider this feedback for a more enjoyable experience. Best regards,",
